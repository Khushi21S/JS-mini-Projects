Implement a counter using setTimeout and setInterval.

read about setInterval and how it works behind the scenes

why clearinterval is required and also 
about what frames per second and how browsers work.

requestAnimationFrame- browser API.


--Modify your counter range
Make it count from 50 → 500 instead of 0 → 1000.


--Multiple counters
Add two <h1> elements and run counters on both at the same time.  ---We are updating the Dom in this case, how can we avoid that.


--Stop the counter at any number
example: stop at 750.

--Change text dynamically while counting

Example: if count < 500 → “Getting started”, if count >= 500 → “Halfway there”.

--Highlight milestones

Example: every 100 counts, make the number bold or change color.

--Trigger a callback

Example: when counter finishes, call your changeText() automatically.

--Make counter a reusable function

Accept start, end, step, delay as parameters.

--Pause/resume counter

Introduce buttons that can pause and resume counting.

--Reset counter

Reset it to the start value and restart.




--Local vs global variables

Try moving count inside the function vs outside. See how behavior changes.


--Non-linear counting

Slow at start, fast at the end — learn about simple math in JS.

---requestAnimationFrame
---suppose we have two counters and we have to stop one of them
