// After we have learnt how to create JavaScript strings, we will now connect 2 strings together. In the code below we use the Addition (+) operator to concatenate textOne and textTwo. The console.log() statement logs the resulting string. Currently, the result would be HelloWorld.
//Change the code below so that the value of res is Hello World

const str1 = "Hello";
const str2 = "hello";
const len = str1.length
const firstChar = str1[0];

console.log(str1 === str2);
